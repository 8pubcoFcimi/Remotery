Now that you know what Age of Empires III Complete Collection is and what it offers, you might be wondering how to play it well. Here are some gameplay tips that can help you improve your skills and enjoy the game more.
 
- **Learn to play with hotkeys**: Hotkeys are keyboard shortcuts that allow you to perform common actions faster and more efficiently. For example, you can press H to select your Town Center, Q to create a settler, or W to advance to the next age. You can customize your hotkeys in the game options or use the standard grid layout. Hotkeys can save you time and give you an edge over your opponents.
- **Never stop creating settlers and villagers**: Settlers and villagers are the backbone of your economy. They gather resources, build structures, and train units. You should always keep your Town Center busy producing them, unless you are saving up resources for something else or you have reached the population limit. More settlers and villagers mean more income, which means more army and upgrades.
- **Scout everything**: Scouting is essential for gathering information about the map and your enemies. You should use your explorer, scout units, or even military units to reveal as much of the map as possible. Scouting can help you find valuable resources, treasures, trade routes, native settlements, and enemy bases. Knowing where your enemies are and what they are doing can help you plan your strategy and counter their moves.
- **Balance your economy**: Your economy should be balanced according to your needs and goals. You should have enough food, wood, gold, and coin to support your army production and research. You should also adjust your resource gathering according to the map and the civilization you are playing. For example, some maps have more hunting than farming opportunities, while some civilizations have bonuses for certain resources.
- **Use the right units**: Age of Empires III has a variety of units with different strengths and weaknesses. You should use the right units for the right situations and avoid using units that are countered by your enemies. For example, infantry are good against cavalry, cavalry are good against artillery, artillery are good against buildings, and so on. You should also use units that complement each other and form a balanced army.

These are just some of the basic tips that can help you play Age of Empires III Complete Collection better. There are many more advanced strategies and tactics that you can learn from playing the game or watching other players. The game also has a tutorial mode called \"Art of War\" that teaches you various aspects of the game in detail. If you want to master this classic strategy game, you should practice a lot and have fun.
